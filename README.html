<h1 id="luukeethemeforwordpress">Luukee Theme for WordPress</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s not much to it! This theme is meant as a simple starting point for your next migration to WordPress.</p>

<p>Note that this theme does not have &#8220;blogging&#8221; templates included.</p>

<p>If you need blog functionality, you can take a look at Twenty Twelve (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve)
or other WordPress themes to see how to add in the basic blog templates.</p>
